  "our_history_paragraph_1":"Hibis was founded in 1998 by Martin Samociuk. Many of the people who joined at the start came from Network Security Management in London, a company which pioneered fraud investigation and prevention in the 1980’s and 90’s. In 1999, Martin was joined by Nigel Krishna Iyer and one year later by Allan McDonagh. Veronica Morino became part of the group in 2001  followed by Richard Minogue in 2002.The mission of Hibis has always been to put prevention and early detection FIRST. We share with clients the need to dramatically raise awareness of fraud and corruption, give them the ability to spot it early and provide advice and resources for well managed investigations. This includes training workshops, seminars, books, publications and films all with the purpose of stimulating this greater awareness and self-reliance.",
  "our_history_paragraph_2":"Hibis has been in continuous operation in the UK since 1999 and in Australia from 2003 to 2013 and in Scandinavia from 1999 – 2008. Today we are proud to again use the Hibis namein Scandinavia.",
  "our_history_paragraph_3":"Sadly, Hibis founder, Martin Samociuk, passed away in 2013 at the age of 62 from pancreatic cancer. He will be missed by all that knew him but we are grateful for the important work he left behind.",
  "our_history_paragraph_4":"Today Hibis is an advisory organisation which we hope will help open people’s eyes to the fact that even though fraud and corruption is all around us, it can be kept under control. Our aim is to provide innovative tools and techniques to deal with it, as well as the confidence to spot it early. We aim to support those people who wish to take a stand against fraud and",

  "what_we_do_list_2_item_2":"Convening “thinking like a thief” sessions (an approach invented in the 1980’s by Martin Samociuk, Hibis’ founder) to anticipate how the fraudsters’ mind works and build a profile of the types of frauds that are occurring or likely to occur",

  "what_we_do_paragraph_1":"Fraud and corruption happens all the time and is arguably one of the greatest unmanaged costs in organisations and society today. Yet most management and employees have not had any practical training in this area. Our aim is to significantly raise awareness of fraud and corruption and its consequences. Wassist and advise organisations, companies and everyone else concerned by:",
  "what_we_do_paragraph_2":"<strong>Assessing</strong> and <strong>measuring</strong> the <strong>effectiveness</strong>, strengths and weaknesses of existing anti-fraud and corruption programmes",
  "what_we_do_paragraph_3":"We are a small group of investigation experts who work quickly and effectively. We have a track record of solving our client’s problems efficiently and with compassion. We believe in the beauty of small investigations that win back value. It is not necessary to chase every suspicion when finding and fixing the “whys” and the “hows” resolves the problem.",
  "what_we_do_paragraph_4":"Of course from time to time exceptional situations occur. When an organisation needs to prepare legal actions to recover major assets or save a business, a deep investigation may be required. We manage investigations, large or small, in a controlled way avoiding unnecessary expenditure and keeping the client in the driver’s seat.",
  "what_we_do_paragraph_5":"There is plenty of fraud and corruption around that needs to be found (preferably in the early stages) and stopped. Usually fraudulent and corrupt activities are cloaked in legitimacy, and finding the truth requires professional scepticism, experience and effort. Our proven methods include:",
  "what_we_do_paragraph_6":"If not detected early, fraud and corruption will spread. Eventually, the problem will be discovered when it becomes too large to ignore, or is reported by whistle-blowers, or both. But why wait for the whistle-blower when you can use fraud detective techniques and uncover where early stage fraud and corruption is developing now? It’s better to stay ahead of the game!",
  "what_we_do_paragraph_7":"We probably will never totally eradicate fraud and corruption. But by raising awareness and managing the risks we can control the cost and make corrupt behaviour less acceptable. Surprisingly, much fraud and corruption involves normal, good people such as valuable and trusted employees or business partners. Awareness is a powerful tool to help good people avoid bad mistakes they will later regret, and to show them how to protect the organisation against career fraudsters. As Nelson Mandela said, education is one of the most powerful ways to change the world. We have developed courses and techniques to bridge the skills gap and constantly look for innovative new ways to raise the awareness, spread knowledge and bring people together in the fight of corruption and fraud. Examples (details can be found in our page) include:",
  "what_we_do_paragraph_8":"The burden of external regulation, designed to protect the public and punish corporate offenders is increasing. This absorbs management attention and leaves less room for more practical programs designed to protect the organisation. Management can fall into the trap of accepting bureaucratic solutions that appear to fulfill regulatory requirements, but which do not effectively address the issue of fraudulent and corrupt behavior. Compliance programs based on checklists are unlikely to be effective!",
