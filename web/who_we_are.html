                                Martina has a combined Masters degree in Business and Economics
                                (majoring in finance) from the Norwegian Business School (BI) and the
                                University of Ljubljana (Slovenia). Right from an early age she wanted to
                                play an active part in eradicating systematic inefficiencies. She recognized
                                that corruption and fraud is one of the major obstacles to sustainability
                                and growth and was able to apply her passion at Hibis. Martina specializes
                                in identifying red flags of corruption through internal and external
                                analysis, and understanding and investigating them across a wide range
                                of countries and languages-zones.
