      Hibis was founded in 1998 by Martin Samociuk. Many of the people who joined at the start
      came from Network Security Management in London, a company which pioneered fraud
      investigation and prevention in the 1980’s and 90’s. In 1999, Martin was joined by
      Nigel Krishna Iyer and one year later by Allan McDonagh. Veronica Morino became part of the
      group in 2001 followed by Richard Minogue in 2002. The mission of Hibis has always been to
      put prevention and early detection FIRST. We share with clients the need to dramatically
      raise awareness of fraud and corruption, give them the ability to spot it early and provide
      advice and resources for well managed investigations. This includes training workshops,
      seminars, books, publications and films all with the purpose of stimulating this greater
      awareness and self-reliance.

      Hibis has been in continuous operation in the UK since 1999 and in Australia from 2003 to
      2013 and in Scandinavia from 1999 – 2008. Today we are proud to again use the Hibis name
      in Scandinavia.
