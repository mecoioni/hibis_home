          Hibis was founded in 1998 by Martin Samociuk. Many of the people who joined at the start
          came from Network Security Management in London, a company which pioneered fraud 
          investigation and prevention in the 1980’s and 90’s. In 1999, Martin was joined by 
          Nigel Krishna Iyer and one year later by Allan McDonagh. Veronica Morino became part of the 
          group in 2001  followed by Richard Minogue in 2002.The mission of Hibis has always been to 
          put prevention and early detection FIRST. We share with clients the need to dramatically 
          raise awareness of fraud and corruption, give them the ability to spot it early and provide 
          advice and resources for well managed investigations. This includes training workshops, 
          seminars, books, publications and films all with the purpose of stimulating this greater 
          awareness and self-reliance.

          Hibis has been in continuous operation in the UK since 1999 and in Australia from 2003 to
          2013 and in Scandinavia from 1999 – 2008. Today we are proud to again use the Hibis name 
          in Scandinavia.

          Sadly, Hibis founder, Martin Samociuk, passed away in 2013 at the age of 62 from 
          pancreatic cancer. He will be missed by all that knew him but we are grateful for the 
          important work he left behind.

        <p style="margin-top:20px; text-align:justify;">
          Today Hibis is an advisory organisation which we hope will help open people’s eyes to the 
          fact that even though fraud and corruption is all around us, it can be kept under control. Our 
          aim is to provide innovative tools and techniques to deal with it, as well as the confidence to 
          spot it early. We aim to support those people who wish to take a stand against fraud and corruption.
