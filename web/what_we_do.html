                "Fraud and corruption happens all the time and is arguably one of the greatest
                unmanaged costs in organisations and society today. Yet most management
                and employees have not had any practical training in this area. Our aim is to
                significantly raise awareness of fraud and corruption and its consequences. We
                assist and advise organisations, companies and everyone else concerned by:

            <h3>We investigate fraud and corruption responsibly</h3>
            <p>
                We are a small group of investigation experts who work quickly and effectively.
                We have a track record of solving our client’s problems efficiently and with
                compassion. We believe in the beauty of small investigations that win back
                value. It is not necessary to chase every suspicion when finding and fixing the
                “whys” and the “hows” resolves the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course from time to time exceptional situations occur. When an organisation
                needs to prepare legal actions to recover major assets or save a business, a
                deep investigation may be required. We manage investigations, large or small,
                in a controlled way avoiding unnecessary expenditure and keeping the client in
                the driver’s seat.
            </p>
          

            <h3>We look for fraud and always find it</h3>
            <p>
                There is plenty of fraud and corruption around that needs to be found
                (preferably in the early stages) and stopped. Usually fraudulent and corrupt
                activities are cloaked in legitimacy, and finding the truth requires professional
                scepticism, experience and effort. Our proven methods include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Delving into the details and performing structured analysis on transactions, data and documents to find the red flags</li>
                <li>
                    Convening “thinking like a thief” sessions (an approach invented in the
                    1980’s by Martin Samociuk, Hibis’ founder) to anticipate how the
                    fraudsters’ mind works and build a profile of the types of frauds that are
                    occurring or likely to occur
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finding behavioural red flags by performing holistic desktop investigative
                    research and analysis of organisations, business partners, suppliers,
                    customers and key individuals. All with a special focus on opportunities,
                    motives and how people rationalize dishonest or unethical behaviour
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If not detected early, fraud and corruption will spread. Eventually, the problem
                will be discovered when it becomes too large to ignore, or is reported by
                whistle-blowers, or both. But why wait for the whistle-blower when you can use
                fraud detective techniques and uncover where early stage fraud and corruption
                is developing now? It’s better to stay ahead of the game!
            </p>
          
          
            <h3>We raise awareness, share knowledge and transfer skills</h3>
            <p>
                We probably will never totally eradicate fraud and corruption. But by raising
                awareness and managing the risks we can control the cost and make corrupt
                behaviour less acceptable. Surprisingly, much fraud and corruption involves
                normal, good people such as valuable and trusted employees or business
                partners. Awareness is a powerful tool to help good people avoid bad mistakes
                they will later regret, and to show them how to protect the organisation against
                career fraudsters. As Nelson Mandela said, education is one of the most
                powerful ways to change the world. We have developed courses and techniques
                to bridge the skills gap and constantly look for innovative new ways to raise the
                awareness, spread knowledge and bring people together in the fight of
                corruption and fraud. Examples (details can be found in our
                <strong><a href="http://academy.hibis.com" target="_blank">Academy</a></strong> page) include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Practical open courses and workshops (including our “think like a thief methodology” and “fraud detective school”)</li>
                <li>Accredited management courses</li>
                <li>On the job-training, in-house workshops and clinics</li>
                <li>Multimedia based training delivered over the internet (or intranet)</li>
                <li>Experiential learning, including drama, scenarios, live simulations, “corruption-theatre” and films</li>
                <li>Publications and books</li>
            </ul>
          
            <h3>We assess the effectiveness of existing anti-fraud and corruption programs</h3>
            <p>
                The burden of external regulation, designed to protect the public and punish
                corporate offenders is increasing. This absorbs management attention and
                leaves less room for more practical programs designed to protect the
                organisation. Management can fall into the trap of accepting bureaucratic
                solutions that appear to fulfill regulatory requirements, but which do not
                effectively address the issue of fraudulent and corrupt behavior. Compliance
                programs based on checklists are unlikely to be effective!
            </p>
            <p>
                We are able to measure the impact and effectiveness of your existing anti-fraud
                and corruption activities, identifying gaps and potential improvements that will
                bring down the cost of fraud and corruption and strengthen the ethical culture.
