                    Fraud and corruption happens all the time and is arguably one of the greatest
                    unmanaged costs in organisations and society today. Yet most management
                    and employees have not had any practical training in this area. Our aim is to
                    significantly raise awareness of fraud and corruption and its consequences. We
                    assist and advise organisations, companies and everyone else concerned by:

                    We are a small group of investigation experts who work quickly and effectively.
                    We have a track record of solving our client’s problems efficiently and with
                    compassion. We believe in the beauty of small investigations that win back
                    value. It is not necessary to chase every suspicion when finding and fixing the
                    “whys” and the “hows” resolves the problem.

                    Of course from time to time exceptional situations occur. When an organisation
                    needs to prepare legal actions to recover major assets or save a business, a
                    deep investigation may be required. We manage investigations, large or small,
                    in a controlled way avoiding unnecessary expenditure and keeping the client in
                    the driver’s seat.

                    There is plenty of fraud and corruption around that needs to be found
                    (preferably in the early stages) and stopped. Usually fraudulent and corruptdd
                    activities are cloaked in legitimacy, and finding the truth requires professional
                    scepticism, experience and effort. Our proven methods include:

                        1980’s by Martin Samociuk, Hibis’ founder) to anticipate how the
                        fraudsters’ mind works and build a profile of the types of frauds that are
                        occurring or likely to occur

                    If not detected early, fraud and corruption will spread. Eventually, the problem
                    will be discovered when it becomes too large to ignore, or is reported by
                    whistle-blowers, or both. But why wait for the whistle-blower when you can use
                    fraud detective techniques and uncover where early stage fraud and corruption
                    is developing now? It’s better to stay ahead of the game!

                    We probably will never totally eradicate fraud and corruption. But by raising
                    awareness and managing the risks we can control the cost and make corrupt
                    behaviour less acceptable. Surprisingly, much fraud and corruption involves
                    normal, good people such as valuable and trusted employees or business
                    partners. Awareness is a powerful tool to help good people avoid bad mistakes
                    they will later regret, and to show them how to protect the organisation against
                    career fraudsters. As Nelson Mandela said, education is one of the most
                    powerful ways to change the world. We have developed courses and techniques
                    to bridge the skills gap and constantly look for innovative new ways to raise the
                    awareness, spread knowledge and bring people together in the fight of

                    The burden of external regulation, designed to protect the public and punish
                    corporate offenders is increasing. This absorbs management attention and
                    leaves less room for more practical programs designed to protect the
                    organisation. Management can fall into the trap of accepting bureaucratic
                    solutions that appear to fulfill regulatory requirements, but which do not
                    effectively address the issue of fraudulent and corrupt behavior. Compliance
                    programs based on checklists are unlikely to be effective!
